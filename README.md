# machine_learning_project-supervised-learning

## Project Outcomes
- Supervised Learning: use supervised learning techniques to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not, based on certain diagnostic measurements.The project involves three main parts: exploratory data analysis, preprocessing and feature engineering, and training a machine learning model. 
## Process
### Exploring: 
I start with deep diving into data to get the better understanding of the dataset. I start exploring the each column of the table and try to be more familiar with it. For this I use capabilities of python to understand the data. I also use Excel as our dataset is in .csv format.
### Cleaning:
Then I start with the cleaning process. Initially we start with the easy going cleaning which are easy to detect and fix. For example eliminating NULL valued rows. Python is a great tool to do that in no-time.
### Analysing:
I analyse 
  - Pregnancies 
  - Glucose
  - BloodPressure
  - SkinThickness
  - Insulin
  - Age
### Interesting Facts about data:
while working with this data I found some interesting outcomes.
- Some people wit 0 Skin Thickness exists, Interesting.....
### Project Description:
In this projects, you will apply supervised learning techniques to a real-world data set and use data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis.
I use two Models for prediction
- SVM
- Random Forest Classifire
I also calculate the score metrics and after comparing this the Random Forest Classifire Model overpower the SVM model and provide more accurate predictions.
### Future Goal:
If I could have more time I want to try more models and also try to configure the best model using hyperparameter tuning.
### Challenges:
Time constraint is the biggest challenge for me for completing this project.
